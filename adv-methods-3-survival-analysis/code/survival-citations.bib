abstract = { Abstract—We compared  systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial  pressure (MAP) in predicting the risk of cardiovascular  disease (CVD), stratifying results at age 60 years, when DBP decreases  while SBP continues to increase. We prospectively followed 11 150 male  physicians with no history of CVD or antihypertensive treatment through  the 2-year questionnaire, after which follow-up began. Reported blood  pressure was averaged from both the baseline and 2-year questionnaires.  During a median follow-up of 10.8 years, there were 905 cases of  incident CVD. For men aged \&lt;60 years (n=8743), those in the highest  versus lowest quartiles of average SBP (≥130 versus \&lt;116  mm Hg), DBP (≥81 versus \&lt;73 mm Hg), and MAP (≥97 versus  \&lt;88 mm Hg) had relative risks (RRs) of CVD of 2.16, 2.23, and  2.52, respectively. Models with average MAP and PP did not add  information compared with models with MAP alone  (P\&gt;0.05). For men aged ≥60 years (n=2407), those in  the highest versus lowest quartiles of average SBP (≥135 versus  \&lt;120 mm Hg), PP (≥55 versus \&lt;44 mm Hg), and MAP (≥99  versus \&lt;91 mm Hg) had RRs of CVD of 1.69, 1.83, and 1.43,  respectively. The addition of other blood pressure measures did not add  information compared with average SBP or PP alone (all  P\&gt;0.05). These data suggest that average SBP, DBP, and  MAP strongly predict CVD among younger men, whereas either average SBP  or PP predicts CVD among older men. More research should distinguish  whether MAP, highly correlated with SBP and DBP, better predicts  CVD. }

abstract = { Arterial stiffening is the principal cause of increasing systolic pressure with advancing years and in patients with arterial hypertension. It is associated with progressive arterial dilation and is due to degeneration of the arterial wall, probably as a consequence of repetitive cyclic stress; it increases systolic pressure directly by increasing amplitude of the pressure wave generated by a given flow impulse from the heart and indirectly by increasing wave velocity so that wave reflection from the periphery occurs earlier, augmenting pressure in late systole. The first mechanism affects pressure in both the central and peripheral arteries, the second predominantly in the central arteries. Change in brachial systolic pressure with age underestimates the rise in systolic pressure in the aorta and left ventricle. Arterial stiffness is reduced passively with reduction in arterial pressure. Drugs have little or no direct effect on arterial stiffness but can markedly reduce wave reflection. In patients with stiffened arteries, reduction in wave reflection decreases aortic systolic pressure augmentation. The decreased systolic pressure in central arteries brought about by this mechanism is not detected when systolic pressure is measured in a peripheral (brachial or radial) artery but can be inferred from change in contour of the pressure wave recorded in peripheral arteries. }

    abstract = { In recent years, breakthroughs in biomedical technology have led to a wealth of data in which the number of features (for instance, genes on which expression measurements are available) exceeds the number of observations (e.g. patients). Sometimes survival outcomes are also available for those same observations. In this case, one might be interested in (a) identifying features that are associated with survival (in a univariate sense), and (b) developing a multivariate model for the relationship between the features and survival that can be used to predict survival in a new observation. Due to the high dimensionality of this data, most classical statistical methods for survival analysis cannot be applied directly. Here, we review a number of methods from the literature that address these two problems. }
